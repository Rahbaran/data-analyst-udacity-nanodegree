# Introduction
The data consists of 14.999 observations with 10 variables. The main feature of
interest is to gain a better understanding which variables might have an impact
why some employees from this company choose to leave. (variable named `left`).
## (Initial) Data Structure
A quick overview first:
```{r Data_Structure}
str(hrd)
summary(hrd)
```
Only two of the 10 variable are of type Factor. The int variables
"Work_accident", "left" and "promotion_last_5years" may solely assume the values
of 0 and 1. The var `sales` is a bit awkwardly named. We are going to change it
to `occupation` and fix the typo in the word "montly".
Out of the 14999 employees, 3571 have left, which equivalents to nearly 24 %:
```{r Univariate_Plots}
# count number of rows where employee left and divide it against ALL rows
nrow(hrd[hrd$left == 1, ])  / nrow(hrd[hrd$left != NA,])
setnames(hrd, old = c('sales','average_montly_hours'),
new = c('occupation','avg_monthly_hours'))
```
Interestingly, "good" employees (defined here as: a rating above the third
quarter) have even a higher rating of leaving (more than 32%):
```{r}
hrd %>% group_by(left, last_evaluation >= 0.87) %>% summarise(n = n())
1231  / 3571
```
# Univariate and Bivariate Plots Section
The univariate and bivariate section are conflated into one section as I prefer
to start the analysis with some general plots built with corrplot and ggpairs.
For the correlation plot, we choose all variables that are not of type factor.
```{r Bivariate_Plots, fig.width=11, fig.height=11}
hrd_cor <- hrd %>% select(satisfaction_level:promotion_last_5years)
M <- cor(hrd_cor)
corrplot(M, method="circle")
ggpairs(hrd)
```
# Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
The correlation plot confirms the obvious: Those who are unsatisfied leave the
company. Besides, "work accidents" and "promotion within the last five years"
also seems to play a role reg. leaving the company.
There's also a negative correlation reg. satisfaction and number of projects
involved.
To get a broader overview, we made use of ggpairs. However, some plots are not
very explanatory due to the variable types and order. We change the order of
salary to high, medium, low and convert the int variables `Work_accident`, `left`
and `promotion_last_5years` to factor variables as they just can assume values
of 0 and 1. Furthermore, as `left` is our main interest here, the charts are
going to be colour coded by this variable.
```{r Bivariate_Plots_2, fig.width=11, fig.height=11}
hrd$salary = factor(hrd$salary, levels = c("high", "medium", "low"))
hrd$left = factor(hrd$left)
hrd$Work_accident = factor(hrd$Work_accident)
hrd$promotion_last_5years = factor(hrd$promotion_last_5years)
ggpairs(hrd) # use mapping = aes(color = left) for multivar analysis
```
The result of ggpairs gives us some more insights. The 25th percentile of the
satisfaction level gets lower and lower, the less the salary (cf. upper right
graph). However, the median and 75th percentile are almost stable.
The share of people who have received a promotion in the last 5 years is
marginal (8th row, 8th column).
If we look at the `left` column (fourth column from the right), we see a much
larger IQR regarding "number of projects" and "average monthly hours" for those
who have left the company.
Let's have a deeper look at `avg_monthly_hours`:
```{r fig.width=11, fig.height=11}
### defining a general function for basic histograms
plot.histobar = function(x.var, y.var = NA, pf) {
p = ggplot(aes_string(x.var), data = pf)
if(is.na(y.var) == TRUE){
p + geom_histogram(bins=25, color = "black", fill = "steelblue")
}
else{
p + geom_bar(aes_string(y = y.var),stat="identity", color = "black",
fill = "steelblue")
}
}
###
plot.histobar("avg_monthly_hours",pf = hrd)
plot.histobar("avg_monthly_hours",pf = hrd) + facet_wrap(~ left)
ggplot(aes(y = avg_monthly_hours, x = left), data=hrd) + geom_boxplot(fill = "steelblue") + stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="point", shape=4, color="orange")
```
The histogram of those who left resembles a bimodal distribution where as the
histogram of the staying employees resembles mostly a unimodal one. Those who
left seem to have worked a lot or not enough. The leaving employees seem to lack
a "golden mean".The boxplots reveal that the distribution for those who stay is
fairly symmetric, i.e. the median is situated in the center of the IQR and it is
very close to the mean. Besides, the whiskers have a similar length. In
comparison, those who left have a broader IQR, the upper whisker is much longer
and the media is clearly above the median and close relatively close to the 25th
percentile.
A quick look considering the impact of job role might also be helpful.
Therefore, we're going to transform the data a bit:
```{r Data_Transform, fig.width=11, fig.height=11}
hrd_promotion_left_by_job = hrd %>%
group_by(occupation) %>%
summarise(promotion_received =
sum(promotion_last_5years == 1 )/n(),
leaving_rate = sum(left == 1 )/n() )
```
```{r fig.width=11, fig.height=11}
plot.histobar("occupation", "leaving_rate", hrd_promotion_left_by_job)
plot.histobar("occupation", "promotion_received", hrd_promotion_left_by_job)
hrd_promotion_left_by_job = hrd %>%
group_by(occupation) %>%
summarise(promotion_received =
sum(promotion_last_5years == 1 )/n(),
leaving_rate = sum(left == 1 )/n() )
plot.histobar("occupation", "promotion_received", hrd_promotion_left_by_job)
hrd_promotion_left_by_job = hrd %>%
group_by(occupation) %>%
summarise(promotion_received =
sum(promotion_last_5years == 1 )/n(),
leaving_rate = sum(left == 1 )/n() )
hrd_promotion_left_by_job = hrd %>%
group_by(occupation) %>%
summarise(promotion_received =
sum(promotion_last_5years == 1 )/n(),
leaving_rate = sum(left == 1 )/n() )
```{r fig.width=11, fig.height=11}
ggplot(aes(avg_monthly_hours, satisfaction_level), data = hrd) +
geom_point(alpha = 1/10,
size = 0.75,
position = position_jitter(h = 0),
color = 'orange')
ggplot(aes(last_evaluation, satisfaction_level), data = hrd) +
geom_point(alpha = 1/10, size = 0.75,
position = position_jitter(h = 0),
color = 'orange')
plot.scatter = function(x.var, y.var, pf, c, a, s) {
ggplot(aes_string(x.var, y.var, color = c), data = pf) +
geom_point(alpha = a, size = s, position = position_jitter(h = 0))
}
plot.scatter('promotion_last_5years', 'satisfaction_level', hrd, 'left',
0.5, 0.75) +
ggtitle("Satisfaction in Relation to Promotion") +
labs(x="Promotion Received (1 = Yes)?",y="Satisfaction Level") +
scale_color_brewer(type = 'qual',
guide = guide_legend(title = 'Employee left?',
reverse = T,
override.aes = list(alpha = 1,

labs(x="Promotion Received (1 = Yes)?",y="Satisfaction Level") +
geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.6)
plot.scatter('promotion_last_5years', 'satisfaction_level', hrd, 'left',

ggtitle("Satisfaction in Relation to Work Accident") +
