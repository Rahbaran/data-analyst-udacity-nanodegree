# Introduction

The data consists of 14.999 observations with 10 variables. The main feature of 
interest is to gain a better understanding which variables might have an impact 
why some employees from this company choose to leave. (variable named `left`).

## (Initial) Data Structure

A quick overview first:

```{r Data_Structure}
str(hrd)
summary(hrd)
```

Only two of the 10 variable are of type Factor. The int variables 
"Work_accident", "left" and "promotion_last_5years" may solely assume the values
of 0 and 1. The var `sales` is a bit awkwardly named. We are going to change it 
to `occupation` and fix the typo in the word "montly".

Out of the 14999 employees, 3571 have left, which equivalents to nearly 24 %:
```{r Univariate_Plots}
# count number of rows where employee left and divide it against ALL rows
nrow(hrd[hrd$left == 1, ])  / nrow(hrd[hrd$left != NA,])
setnames(hrd, old = c('sales','average_montly_hours'), 
         new = c('occupation','avg_monthly_hours'))
```

Interestingly, "good" employees (defined here as: a rating above the third
quarter) have even a higher rating of leaving (more than 32%):

```{r}
hrd %>% group_by(left, last_evaluation >= 0.87) %>% summarise(n = n())
1231  / 3571
```


# Univariate and Bivariate Plots Section
The univariate and bivariate section are conflated into one section as I prefer
to start the analysis with some general plots built with corrplot and ggpairs. 
For the correlation plot, we choose all variables that are not of type factor.

```{r Bivariate_Plots, fig.width=11, fig.height=11}
hrd_cor <- hrd %>% select(satisfaction_level:promotion_last_5years)
M <- cor(hrd_cor)
corrplot(M, method="circle")
ggpairs(hrd)
```

# Univariate and Bivariate Analysis

The correlation plot confirms the obvious: Those who are unsatisfied leave the 
company. Besides, "work accidents" and "promotion within the last five years"
also seems to play a role reg. leaving the company. 
There's also a negative correlation reg. satisfaction and number of projects 
involved.

To get a broader overview, we made use of ggpairs. However, some plots are not 
very explanatory due to the variable types and order. We change the order of 
salary to high, medium, low and convert the int variables `Work_accident`, `left` 
and `promotion_last_5years` to factor variables as they just can assume values
of 0 and 1. Furthermore, as `left` is our main interest here, the charts are 
going to be colour coded by this variable.

```{r Bivariate_Plots_2, fig.width=11, fig.height=11}
hrd$salary = factor(hrd$salary, levels = c("high", "medium", "low"))
hrd$left = factor(hrd$left)
hrd$Work_accident = factor(hrd$Work_accident)
hrd$promotion_last_5years = factor(hrd$promotion_last_5years)
ggpairs(hrd) # use mapping = aes(color = left) for multivar analysis

```

The result of ggpairs gives us some more insights. The 25th percentile of the 
satisfaction level gets lower and lower, the less the salary (cf. upper right
graph). However, the median and 75th percentile are almost stable.

The share of people who have received a promotion in the last 5 years is 
marginal (8th row, 8th column).

If we look at the `left` column (fourth column from the right), we see a much
larger IQR regarding "number of projects" and "average monthly hours" for those
who have left the company. 

Let's have a deeper look at `avg_monthly_hours`:

```{r fig.width=11, fig.height=11}
### defining a general function for basic histograms
plot.histobar = function(x.var, y.var = NA, pf) {
  p = ggplot(aes_string(x.var), data = pf)
  if(is.na(y.var) == TRUE){
    p + geom_histogram(bins=25, color = "black", fill = "steelblue")
  }  
  else{
    p + geom_bar(aes_string(y = y.var),stat="identity", color = "black", 
                 fill = "steelblue")
  }
}
###

plot.histobar("avg_monthly_hours",pf = hrd)
plot.histobar("avg_monthly_hours",pf = hrd) + facet_wrap(~ left)

ggplot(aes(y = avg_monthly_hours, x = left), data=hrd) + geom_boxplot(fill = "steelblue") + stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="point", shape=4, color="orange")

```

The histogram of those who left resembles a bimodal distribution where as the
histogram of the staying employees resembles mostly a unimodal one. Those who 
left seem to have worked a lot or not enough. The leaving employees seem to lack
a "golden mean".The boxplots reveal that the distribution for those who stay is 
fairly symmetric, i.e. the median is situated in the center of the IQR and it is
very close to the mean. Besides, the whiskers have a similar length. In 
comparison, those who left have a broader IQR, the upper whisker is much longer
and the media is clearly above the median and close relatively close to the 25th
percentile.

A quick look considering the impact of job role might also be helpful. 
Therefore, we're going to transform the data a bit:

```{r Data_Transform, fig.width=11, fig.height=11}
hrd_promotion_left_by_job = hrd %>% 
                              group_by(occupation) %>% 
                              summarise(promotion_received = 
                                          sum(promotion_last_5years == 1 )/n(), 
                              leaving_rate = sum(left == 1 )/n() )
```

```{r fig.width=11, fig.height=11}
plot.histobar("occupation", "leaving_rate", hrd_promotion_left_by_job)
plot.histobar("occupation", "promotion_received", hrd_promotion_left_by_job)
```

The last two graphs give indeed some insights about the relavance of the job 
role. Employees in management leave less, maybe because they're more likely to
receive a promotion? Poor people in product management don't get any promotion 
at all. 

Although ggpairs has given some insights at a glance, some of the 100 plots
shown are overplotted. So, let's replot some of them:

```{r fig.width=11, fig.height=11}
ggplot(aes(avg_monthly_hours, satisfaction_level), data = hrd) +
  geom_point(alpha = 1/10, 
             size = 0.75, 
             position = position_jitter(h = 0),
             color = 'orange')

ggplot(aes(last_evaluation, satisfaction_level), data = hrd) +
  geom_point(alpha = 1/10, size = 0.75, 
             position = position_jitter(h = 0),
             color = 'orange')
```

Here we see some interesting patterns. There's a "cohort" with employees working
240+ hours who seem to be very unhappy. In the next figure, we see very well
evaluated employees (0.75+), with a similar `satisfaction_level` as those
working 240+ hours. 

# Multivariate Plots and Analysis Section

It's interesting to see if many of these well evaluated and much working
employees have already left.

```{r Multivariate_Plots_1, fig.width=11, fig.height=11}
###
### defining a general function for multivariate scatter plots
plot.scatter = function(x.var, y.var, pf, c, a, s) {
  ggplot(aes_string(x.var, y.var, color = c), data = pf) +
    geom_point(alpha = a, size = s, position = position_jitter(h = 0)) 
} 
###

plot.scatter('last_evaluation', 'satisfaction_level', hrd, 'left', 0.5, 0.75) +
  ggtitle("Satisfaction in Relation to Last Evaluation") + 
  scale_color_brewer(type = 'qual', 
                     guide = guide_legend(title = 'Employee left?', 
                                          reverse = T, 
                                          override.aes = list(alpha = 1, 
                                                              size = 3)))
```

This first graph clearly shows that people of two specific cohorts tend to leave.
The first cohort is evaluated between roughly  0.425 and 0.575 and has a 
satisfaction level between 0.35 and 0.45. This specific "purple island" in the
middle of the figure leads to some questions. Why aren't employees prone to leave,
whose satisfaction level is below 0.35? Are they cognitively biased to feel 
unsatisfied no matter who their employer is? An analogous question concerns the
last evaluation: why do employees with a score of less than 0.425 actually stay?
Are they generally afraid of the quality of their working skills and hence assume
they won't find a new job? Far more concerning is the state of the second leaving
cohort as they have been very well evaluated by the employer (i.e., 0.77+). This
group is extremely dissatisfied (satisfaction level 0.125 and less). Do they 
leave because they know what their worth in the working market?

```{r  Multivariate_Plots_2, fig.width=11, fig.height=11}

plot.scatter('avg_monthly_hours', 'satisfaction_level', hrd, 'left', 0.5, 0.75) +
  ggtitle("Satisfaction in Relation to Average Monthly Hours") + 
  scale_color_brewer(type = 'qual', 
                     guide = guide_legend(title = 'Employee left?', 
                                          reverse = T, 
                                          override.aes = list(alpha = 1, 
                                                              size = 3)))
```

The second figure looks strikingly similar to the one above. It shows that the
top rated employees with low satisfaction also work a lot. Half of the cohort 
works more than 275 hours per month, which is rarely the case for others â€” 
except  of a few individuals who have mostly left, too (glance through the 
righter fifth of the chart from above to spot the purple dots). So we can surely
say that long working hours has a very strong correlation on leaving and a
weaker but still strong correlation to the employee's satisfaction level.

```{r echo=FALSE, Multivariate_Plots_3, fig.width=11, fig.height=11}
# prepare buckets for boxplots
hrd$number_project_bucket = cut(hrd$number_project, breaks = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7))

plot.scatter('number_project_bucket', 'satisfaction_level', hrd, 'left', 0.5, 0.75) +
  ggtitle("Satisfaction in Relation to Number of Projects") + 
  scale_color_brewer(type = 'qual', 
                     guide = guide_legend(title = 'Employee left?', 
                                          reverse = T, 
                                          override.aes = list(alpha = 1, 
                                                              size = 1))) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.6) + stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="point", 
                                           shape=4, color="orange")
```

The third graph summarizes some very relevant information to our question why
employees leave. Employees leave who either have a lot of projects or too few 
and whose satisfaction level is below roughly 0.45. The "sweet spot" of project 
numbers seems to be three. People with three projects barely leave and to be more
satisfied with their work (around 0.48+). The reason that three projects is a 
good balance might be that employees are neither underwhelmed nor overwhelmed 
reg. quantity of work. Plus, three different projects seems to be a good number
for not being bored by repetitive work (which might be the case if there is only
1-2 projects) but also the chance of getting bogged down in too many projects is
low in contrast to too many projects.

Besides evaluation and "hours/project-load", maybe promotions, work accidents
and how much time an employee spent in the company could have an influence 
on leaving.

```{r Multivariate_Plots_4, fig.width=11, fig.height=11}
plot.scatter('promotion_last_5years', 'satisfaction_level', hrd, 'left', 
             0.5, 0.75) +
  ggtitle("Satisfaction in Relation to Promotion") +
  labs(x="Promotion Received (1 = Yes)?",y="Satisfaction Level") + 
  scale_color_brewer(type = 'qual', 
                     guide = guide_legend(title = 'Employee left?', 
                                          reverse = T, 
                                          override.aes = list(alpha = 1, 
                                                              size = 3)))
```

The fourth graph shows that people who don't get promoted are more likely to 
leave than those who do.

```{r Multivariate_Plots_5, fig.width=11, fig.height=11}
plot.scatter('promotion_last_5years', 'satisfaction_level', hrd, 'left',
             0.5, 0.75) +
  ggtitle("Satisfaction in Relation to Work Accident") +
  labs(x="Work accident happened (1 = Yes)?",y="Satisfaction Level") + 
  scale_color_brewer(type = 'qual', 
                     guide = guide_legend(title = 'Employee left?', 
                                          reverse = T, 
                                          override.aes = list(alpha = 1, 
                                                              size = 3)))
```

The fifth graph does NOT show that people who have had an accident are prone to
leave, which I would have expected. 

```{r Multivariate_Plots_6, fig.width=11, fig.height=11}
plot.scatter('time_spend_company', 'satisfaction_level', hrd, 'left', 
             0.5, 0.75) +
  ggtitle("Satisfaction in Relation to Time Spent in the Company") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(x="Time Spent in the Company",y="Satisfaction Level") + 
  scale_color_brewer(type = 'qual', 
                     guide = guide_legend(title = 'Employee left?', 
                                          reverse = T, 
                                          override.aes = list(alpha = 1, 
                                                              size = 3)))
```

The sixth graph shows indeed that's there's a "sweet spot"" when people tend
to leave. Many employees leave between 2.5 and 4 years if they're unhappy. Maybe
that's the time whey they're fed up and those who pass this "fed-up-phase"" just
accept their fate and stay with the company. Those who are more satisfied are 
likely to leave between four to six years. A hypothesis could be that after this
time it's time foster their own career if they don't get promoted.

```{r Multivariate_Plots_7, fig.width=11, fig.height=11}
ggplot(hrd, aes(salary, occupation, 
                z = avg_monthly_hours)) + 
  stat_summary_2d(aes(colour = avg_monthly_hours)) + 
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = c("purple","orange"), name = "avg monthly hours")
```

The last paragraph also highlights some issues. Marketing employees with high salaries work the least but those with low salaries the a lot.Also, hr people with high salaries work more than hours. 

# Bonus: Machine Learning
Analyzing the data via statistical learning and machine learning, respectively
was not part of this project's requirement. However, due to gaining some practice
with ML in R, curiosity and a better understanding of the data, a brief section
is dedicated to the topic. 

To keep interpret ability of the data, we begin with a simple decision tree.

```{r fig.width=11, Machine_Learning}

#print(importance_matrix)
xgb.plot.importance(importance_matrix = importance_matrix, top_n = 5)
```

Except of the feature weighting, there are no huge surprises here. Our algorithm
puts `satisfaction_level` by far first - which seems common sense though. 
However, it's more intriguing to see that `satisfaction_level` alone is weighted
all other features combined (almost 55%). The smaller half is made up just by 
features No. 2-4 (side note: the rest of features donâ€™t play a role out all, 
hence I cut them off).

### Description One

This first final plot is equivalent to the second plot in the multivariate 
section. The plot illustrated that the two leaving cohorts in the lower end and 
mid left have a different work load. Plus, both cohorts are not very happy about
their situation and hence might leave because of this reason.

### Plot Two

```{r Plot_Two, fig.width=11, fig.height=11}
plot.scatter('promotion_last_5years', 'satisfaction_level', hrd, 'left', 
             0.5, 0.75) +
  ggtitle("Satisfaction in Relation to Promotion") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(x="Promotion Received (1 = Yes)?",y="Satisfaction Level") + 
  scale_color_brewer(type = 'qual', 
                     guide = guide_legend(title = 'Employee left?', 
                                          reverse = T, 
                                          override.aes = list(alpha = 1, 
                                                              size = 3)))
```

### Description Two

The second plot shows the importance of a promotion. Looking at 
employees with a satifaction level around 0.75 and above still have a high 
likelihood to leave if they don't receive any promotion.

### Plot Three

```{r Plot_Three, fig.width=11, fig.height=11}
temp <- hrd_promotion_left_by_job %>% 
  gather("type", "n", 2:3)

plot.histobar("occupation", "n", temp) + 
  ggtitle("Promotion Rate per Department") + 
  labs(x="Department",y="Promotion Rate") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  facet_grid(type~.)
```

### Description Three

Also, the management has the lowest leaving rate probably partially due to their
high promotion rate.

# Reflection
To me, this project was very exciting as it was also an introduction to the
kaggle site. There, I found this data set via the latest upvotes. 

I had some issues with the data set as there was no cookbook. What does projects
involved exactly mean? Does the value refer to all the projects in an employee's
career with the company, average yearly projects or even the current status 
(i.e., involved in simultaneous projects)? The salary variable is also a bit dissatisfactory. When is the salary defined as high or low? In comparison to 
other employees? If so, to all employees or only to the peers (e.g. comparing to
other accountants)? Or is it a comparison to some industry standards? Also 
confusing: What is exactly a work accident?

I really enjoyed the functions corrplot and ggpairs as they quickly give you a 
quick overview regarding univariate and bivariate analysis. I'm grateful that 
Udacity introduced us to the GGally library. Suddenly plotting
*_100 visualizations_* tremendously speeds up the EDA-process. However, for me
it was difficult to gain additional insights from the uni- and bivariate 
analysis to the multivariate analysis.

In future works, the salary as a number variable would be interesting as we 
would get a finer view how salary might correlate with evaluation and working 
hours.

I added the machine learning section because I had started taking the machine 
learning class nearly simultaneously. It was a good exercise to "convert" 
concepts from the ml-course, which were taut in Python, into R.

Nonetheless, it was a lot of fun and I hope to learn more regarding predictions,
soon.
