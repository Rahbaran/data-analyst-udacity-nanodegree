## About

This final project might be different than other submissions as it is a real use case from my employer (data anonymised). My employer is getting more and more into data science services and one of the tasks was data visualisation task which I was assigned to. Although due to the anonymisation the "narrative" is severely impeded, I still chose this project to give a real life example and show how Udacity's course actually build the fundament to pursue this project.
Our client needed an interactive visualisation to gain an overview which of his products and services are integrated into which websites. The main diagram is on page2.html. The Services arcs have a lighter color and no chords because they are passive â€“ they have been integrated into the companies.
